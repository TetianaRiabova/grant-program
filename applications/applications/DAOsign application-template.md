## Project Overview 

- Project: DAOsign
- Team Name: DAOsign 
- Payment Address: 0x793F7a7542c14088dbF58A19d2687FB9E7A79482

### Overview

DAOsign is a decentralized platform for agreements and automated workflows, with publicly verifiable, cryptographic proofs-of-signature, designed for DAOs and WEB3 companies.

Verifiable Signature is at the core of DAOsign and is based on 3 key proofs: proof-of-identify, proof-of-authority, and proof-of-agreement. Utilizing these proofs, DAOsign provides a platform to design and configure complex workflows that combine smart-contract-based automation with authorized approvals.

DAOsign addresses the need for a secure and transparent way to sign, manage and automate agreements of all kinds with a configurable level of anonymity disclosure.
